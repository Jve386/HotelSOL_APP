# RocketTeam-HotelSOL_APP

## üõ† Technical Overview

This project synergizes technologies from both the .NET and Python ecosystems to deliver a robust room reservation management application. The .NET components facilitate distributed data programming, with seamless access to SQL Server databases and native XML databases. The core objective is to integrate with Odoo, utilizing Python for efficient CRUD operations and system interaction.

### üöÄ Technologies Used

- **.NET Ecosystem Components:** Employed for robust application development, including ADO.NET, ASP.NET, BCL, and C# Windows Forms.

- **ADO.NET:** Used to access and manage databases within .NET applications, ensuring efficient data handling.

- **ASP.NET:** Leveraged for the creation of web applications within the .NET environment.

- **Base Class Library (BCL):** Utilized for fundamental functionalities shared across all .NET applications, simplifying development.

- **C# Windows Forms:** Chosen for creating desktop applications tailored for the Windows platform.

- **Python:** Utilized for its versatility and ease of integration with Odoo.

- **Odoo API:** Leveraged for seamless connectivity and interaction with the Odoo platform.

### üßê Conclusions and Justification for Choices

- **System.Xml Library:** Selected for its robust support in working with XML data in .NET, offering user-friendly functionality for basic read and write operations.

- **Entity Framework Core:** Opted for its excellence in advanced XML data manipulation, providing an effective means to model and manipulate data through data models and queries, especially advantageous for complex read and write operations.

- **XmlReader and XmlTextWriter:** Adopted for efficient handling of large XML files and precise control over data read and write operations. These classes facilitate sequential data processing without loading the entire document into memory.

### üß© Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Used

- Entity Framework Core
